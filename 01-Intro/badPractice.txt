npm run built in frontend

dist folder is genereated
it is moved to backend

and use static to use proxy

app.use(express.static(dist));

it runs the code 
but when we update frontend then we need to delete dist folder in backend 
and make new dist folder and put in backend again and again

so we shold let them be segragated
